Question 1 – Controlled Multiplication Loop

Uses a while loop to multiply consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold.
Prints the final product and the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.

Question 2 – Nested Dictionary from Strings

Takes a list of strings and builds a dictionary where:

Each key is a string from the list

Each value contains the string length and whether the length is even or odd

Question 3 – Safe Function Application

Defines a power function and safely applies it to a list of (base, exponent) pairs.
Negative exponents are skipped and valid results are stored in a list.

Question 4 – Sorted Search with Conditions

Generates random values, sorts them, and finds indices where values are greater than or equal to a random threshold.
Prints the sorted list, threshold value, and first matching index.

Question 5 – Circle Area Comparison with Validation

Validates two circle radii, computes their areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle covered by the smaller one.
Returns error messages for invalid input.

Question 6 – Distribution Analysis

Builds a dictionary showing the cumulative percentage of values less than or equal to each unique number in a list.
The final dictionary is sorted by key.

Question 7 – Time Conversion Function

Converts seconds since midnight into a formatted time string (HH:MM:SS AM/PM).


Question 8 – Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column

Creates a pandas DataFrame from given data and adds a new column derived from existing columns.
